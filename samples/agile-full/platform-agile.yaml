name: "Commercial Banking Cash Management Platform"
description: "Unified platform for commercial banking cash management services, supporting client onboarding, service enrollment, user management, and approval workflows across North American markets"

vision:
  futureStateDescription: |
    A modern, scalable cash management platform that empowers commercial banking clients across Canada and the US
    to self-manage their banking services, users, and approval workflows through a unified digital experience.
    The platform eliminates manual processes, reduces operational overhead, and provides clients with real-time
    control over their banking relationships while maintaining robust security and compliance standards.

  customerNeeds:
    targetCustomers:
      - "Existing Canadian commercial clients (Payedge initiative) requiring online Receivables service enrollment"
      - "Indirect clients (payors) managed by direct commercial clients, requiring receivable-approval service access"
      - "Mid-market and large commercial clients with complex organizational structures and approval hierarchies"
      - "Small business clients needing basic receivables and payment management capabilities"
      - "Future: US-based commercial clients requiring cross-border receivables capabilities"

    problemsBeingSolved:
      - "Payedge Receivables initiative cannot launch without platform support for client onboarding and user management"
      - "No existing receivables service to digitize - this is a new service offering requiring greenfield platform"
      - "Legacy Express platform (big ball of mud) cannot be modified or extended for new receivables service"
      - "Express manages users for direct clients but has no concept of indirect clients (payors)"
      - "No capability to onboard and manage indirect clients (payors) who need to approve invoices"
      - "Bank employees lack portal to manage online profile enrollment and view indirect client relationships"
      - "Indirect clients cannot self-manage their users, permissions, and approval rules for invoice processing"
      - "No generic approval workflow engine - each service implements custom approval logic"
      - "No configurable approval rules for receivables workflows (single, dual, threshold-based approvals)"
      - "No unified view for bank employees to monitor three-tier relationship: Bank → Direct Client → Indirect Clients (payors)"

    valueProposition: |
      Enable Payedge to launch new Receivables service by delivering a dual-portal platform: (1) employee portal
      for bank staff to manage client enrollment and monitor indirect client relationships; (2) self-service portal
      for indirect clients (payors) to independently manage their users, permissions, and approval rules. Generic
      approval workflow engine supports flexible invoice approval patterns (single/dual approver, thresholds).

  solutionIntent:
    approach: |
      Build a domain-driven, API-first platform with clear bounded contexts for client management, service enrollment,
      user management, and permission/approval orchestration. Leverage event-driven architecture for cross-context
      communication and maintain loose coupling with external account systems through adapter patterns.

    keyCapabilities:
      - "Employee portal for bank staff to manage Canadian online profile enrollment (primary use case for MVP)"
      - "Employee portal provides unified view into direct clients and their indirect client (payor) relationships"
      - "Online profile with single primary client (MVP); secondary client support deferred to post-MVP"
      - "Indirect client (payor) profile creation and management (~700 BUSINESS payors for MVP large client)"
      - "Indirect client types: BUSINESS ONLY (business name + related persons with roles) - NO individuals in MVP"
      - "~1050 indirect client users across 700 business payors (average 1.5 users per business)"
      - "Dual identity provider strategy: Okta for indirect clients (MVP), A-and-P for direct clients (via Express)"
      - "Full user lifecycle management for indirect clients in Okta: create, update, activate, deactivate, lock, unlock"
      - "Platform creates and manages indirect client users in Okta (platform owns identity lifecycle)"
      - "Anti-corruption layer: consume Express user events (add, update) - Express WILL BE MODIFIED to publish events"
      - "Near real-time user synchronization from Express via event streaming - unidirectional (Express → Platform) for direct client users"
      - "Daily batch synchronization from SRF for client-owned accounts (account list, status, updates)"
      - "Data engineering capabilities for managing data replication from Express and SRF"
      - "Online profile with site-id linking to Express profile for user replication (direct client users only)"
      - "Direct client users managed in Express with A-and-P authentication - platform replicates for permission/approval enforcement"
      - "Indirect client users fully managed in platform with Okta authentication - NEW capability"
      - "Self-service portal for indirect clients to manage their own users (via platform → Okta integration), permissions, and approval rules"
      - "Receivable-approval service for indirect clients with self-service invoice approval workflows"
      - "Generic approval workflow engine: single approver OR multiple approvers (parallel only)"
      - "Approval workflow lifecycle: submit → pending → approved/rejected/expired"
      - "Approval rule configuration: approver count (1 or N), amount thresholds (parallel approval when multiple approvers required)"
      - "Parallel approval: ALL required approvers must approve (no sequential approval in MVP)"
      - "Three-tier relationship management: Bank → Direct Client (large client) → Indirect Clients (700 business payors)"
      - "Bank-managed permission and approval rules for large client (MVP); platform stores and enforces rules"
      - "Account enrollment supporting Canadian DDA accounts for payor invoice payments"

    technicalDirection: |
      Modern microservices architecture with domain-driven design principles, event-driven integration patterns,
      and cloud-native deployment. API-first design with dual data integration strategies: near real-time event
      streaming (Express user events) and daily batch synchronization (SRF account data). Data engineering
      capabilities for managing data replication, transformation, and quality from external systems. Identity
      federation with dual providers: A-and-P (direct clients via Express) and Okta (indirect clients). Data
      residency and sovereignty considerations for multi-region deployment.

      - "Employee portal provides end-to-end visibility: direct client enrollment through indirect client monitoring"
      - "Three-tier client hierarchy: Direct commercial clients can onboard and monitor their indirect clients (payors)"
      - "Indirect clients have full self-service capabilities: manage users (via Okta), permissions, approval rules independently"
      - "Generic approval workflow engine with flexible rules: single/dual approver, sequential/parallel, amount thresholds"
      - "Approval workflow supports receivable-approval service for indirect clients (invoice approval)"
      - "Flexible client identification: SRF for direct clients, IND for indirect clients (person or business)"
      - "Platform enables new business model: clients can offer receivables services to their business partners"
      - "Future: Corporate structure support via secondary client linking (post-MVP)"
      - "Future: Migrate direct client users to Okta when Express is decommissioned"

  motivationalNarrative: |
    Payedge is ready to launch a brand-new Receivables service—something we've never offered before. A large commercial
    client wants to bring 700 of their business partners (payors) onto the platform by June 2026. This isn't replacing
    a manual process—we're creating a new digital service from scratch. And we can't launch without the right platform.

    We need three things to succeed: First, an employee portal where our bank staff can efficiently enroll Canadian online
    profiles and monitor 700 indirect client relationships. Second, a self-service portal where those 700 payors can
    independently manage their users, set their approval rules, and process invoices. Third, a generic approval workflow
    engine that supports flexible rules—single approver for small invoices, dual approval for large amounts, configurable
    thresholds for each payor.

    Today, none of this exists. We're manually managing users from our legacy Express system. We have no portal for
    employees or payors. We have no approval engine—every service builds custom approval logic. We're at risk of losing
    this client and missing the entire Receivables opportunity.

    We're building the platform that makes this possible. Employee portal for efficient bank operations. Self-service
    portal for payor independence. Generic approval workflow engine supporting flexible, configurable rules. Near
    real-time Express integration so users flow automatically. A three-tier model that turns our client into a platform
    for their partners.

    This is our moment. By June 2026, we launch a new service with one large client, 700 payors, and 700 approval
    workflows. We prove the model works. Then we scale—more clients, more services, corporate structure support, US
    expansion. We're not just enabling Payedge. We're building the foundation for the next decade of commercial banking
    innovation.

  decisionFramework:
    guidingPrinciples:
      - "Client empowerment first - enable self-service wherever possible"
      - "Build for reuse - every component should serve multiple services"
      - "Domain-driven design - clear boundaries, ubiquitous language, loose coupling"
      - "API-first - all capabilities exposed through well-defined APIs"
      - "Security and compliance are non-negotiable - build controls into the platform"
      - "Design for multi-region from day one - not a future retrofit"
      - "Eventual consistency is acceptable where real-time is not required"
      - "Anti-corruption layer is mandatory for legacy system integration - protect domain from Express big ball of mud"
      - "Do not modify legacy systems (Express) - consume via events, translate into domain model"
      - "Separate concerns: Express owns direct client users, platform owns indirect client users"

    tradeoffCriteria:
      - "Speed to market vs. perfect architecture - favor iterative delivery with solid foundations"
      - "Feature richness vs. platform stability - stability wins, add features incrementally"
      - "Custom solutions vs. generic patterns - always prefer generic, reusable patterns"
      - "Real-time integration vs. batch - use batch where latency is acceptable to reduce coupling"
      - "Build vs. buy - buy for identity, build for domain-specific capabilities"

    alignmentMechanisms:
      - "Bi-weekly product review with stakeholders to validate priorities"
      - "Architecture review board for technical decisions impacting multiple teams"
      - "Quarterly roadmap review aligned with business objectives"
      - "Regular user feedback sessions with commercial banking clients"

      alignmentToProductVision: |
        This MVP release directly enables the core product vision of launching Payedge Receivables service
        and establishing the platform foundation for future services. It delivers the three-tier client model
        (Bank → Client → Payors), dual-portal architecture (employee + self-service), modern identity
        integration (Okta), and generic approval workflow engine that are central to the platform's strategic
        value. By proving the model with one large client and 700 payors, this release validates the business
        case for enterprise-wide scaling and additional service launches.

      motivationalNarrative: |
        We're not just launching a product—we're launching a new business model. A large commercial client
        wants to bring 700 of their business partners onto our receivables platform by June 2026. This is
        greenfield territory: a brand-new service we've never offered before.

        Today, we have no portal for bank staff to manage enrollments. We have no self-service portal for
        payors. We have no approval workflow engine. We're manually managing users from a legacy system.
        We're at risk of losing this client and missing the entire Payedge opportunity.

        By June 2026, we deliver: An employee portal where bank staff efficiently enroll clients and monitor
        700 payor relationships. A self-service portal where payors independently manage their 1050 users
        (via Okta), set permissions, and approve invoices. A generic approval workflow engine supporting
        flexible rules—single approver for small invoices, dual approval for large amounts.

        This is our proof point. One client, 700 payors, 1050 Okta users, 700 approval workflows. We prove
        the three-tier model works. Then we scale—more clients, more services, US expansion, corporate
        structures. We're building the foundation for the next decade of commercial banking innovation.
