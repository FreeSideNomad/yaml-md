          <header><h2>Vision: A modern, scalable cash management platform that empowers commercial banking clients across Canada and the US
to self-manage their banking services, users, and approval workflows through a unified digital experience.
The platform eliminates manual processes, reduces operational overhead, and provides clients with real-time
control over their banking relationships while maintaining robust security and compliance standards.
 Payedge is ready to launch a brand-new Receivables service—something we&#x27;ve never offered before. A large commercial
client wants to bring 700 of their business partners (payors) onto the platform by June 2026. This isn&#x27;t replacing
a manual process—we&#x27;re creating a new digital service from scratch. And we can&#x27;t launch without the right platform.

We need three things to succeed: First, an employee portal where our bank staff can efficiently enroll Canadian online
profiles and monitor 700 indirect client relationships. Second, a self-service portal where those 700 payors can
independently manage their users, set their approval rules, and process invoices. Third, a generic approval workflow
engine that supports flexible rules—single approver for small invoices, dual approval for large amounts, configurable
thresholds for each payor.

Today, none of this exists. We&#x27;re manually managing users from our legacy Express system. We have no portal for
employees or payors. We have no approval engine—every service builds custom approval logic. We&#x27;re at risk of losing
this client and missing the entire Receivables opportunity.

We&#x27;re building the platform that makes this possible. Employee portal for efficient bank operations. Self-service
portal for payor independence. Generic approval workflow engine supporting flexible, configurable rules. Near
real-time Express integration so users flow automatically. A three-tier model that turns our client into a platform

This is our moment. By June 2026, we launch a new service with one large client, 700 payors, and 700 approval
workflows. We prove the model works. Then we scale—more clients, more services, corporate structure support, US
expansion. We&#x27;re not just enabling Payedge. We&#x27;re building the foundation for the next decade of commercial banking
